WPC Share Cart is a simple but powerful tool that can help your customer share their cart.

== Description ==

**WPC Share Cart for WooCommerce** is a plugin for saving, sharing, replacing, and restoring cart via an auto-generated link with other users or via social media. WPC Share Cart can be utilized for sharing products directly from any WooCommerce store or saving item lists as Wishlist or Saved for Later. This helps to reduce the time spent searching, grouping products together in order to buy.
